!!! warning "Just in case..."
    Although these pages may be more practical than Discord and are kept as up to date as possible, we still recommend **referring directly to the rules on the Isla Nycta Discord in the event of a dispute with another player**.

## What's these pages about ?
These pages provide an alternative format for accessing, browsing and especially **searching** through the many profiles and rules of the dinosaurs on the Path of Titans Isla Nycta server. Press ++slash++ and start searching âœ¨

## Is everything here up to date ?
We are doing our very best to ensure that this is the case. The information in the **ðŸ¥© Carnivores** and **ðŸŒ¿ Herbivores** sections is sourced from [another project](https://github.com/Yldales/isla-nycta-json), which we maintain along with any contributor who would like to help keep these information up to date or report an error.
