!!! warning
    Attempting to abuse loopholes in these rules may still result in punishment. We expect you to use common sense when playing here, as the rules would have to be 5 pages long if we clarified every grey area. If you have questions on if something is allowed or not, contact a staff member or don't do it. Website Based Rules ~~and Profiles:~~ https://isla-nycta.com/pot-rules

- While it's not mandatory, changing your discord to match your in game name and/or Alderon ID will make it easier to contact you about possible strikes/bans. 
- Video  or replay evidence is needed for <#747745677915848754>! You can find different ways to record and upload your videos in <#747744607525404743>. Unless it is a chat related offense, we do not take word of mouth. Screen shots are acceptable on a case by case basis. 
- Toxicity is not welcome here. If you are being asked to stop by a staff member and you continue you can be kicked or banned depending on the severity. Racism/homophobia/hate speech/etc is not tolerated in our servers whatsoever and will result in an immediate community ban without warning. 
    - On this note, do not grief others. Just because something "isn't a rule break" doesn't mean that it should be used in order to repeatedly harass and or grief others. 
- Outside of events Admin do not grow players. If a growth event occurs, please do not ask to be grown. Chances are you will not be. Admin will not teleport you to friends outside of rule breaks.
- Do not impersonate staff or an Alderon developer by claiming you are one, or by changing your in game name. 
- Being a Supporter, Booster or even a staff member does not make you exempt from the rules.
- Restarts occur at <t:1728720000:t>, <t:1728734400:t>, <t:1731603600:t>, <t:1728763200:t>, <t:1728777600:t>, <t:1728792000:t> in your time zone.
