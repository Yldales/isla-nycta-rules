    - They may take a chunk with them and return to the corpse once the carnivore is away from it.
- Herbivores must show aggression to Carnivores in their personal space. Herbivores can protect their personal space from other Herbivores as well if they so choose, but are not required to unless its profile mandatory.

    - Herbivores should not go out of their way to make another character enter their personal space just to be aggressive towards them.
    - If a carnivore makes an attack in the herbivores personal space, it can be considered a hunt, even if it wasn't the intended target.

    - Only exceptions are a body being left near a bush being actively guarded, near nests, or in a lake claimed by Deinocheirus. The carnivore **MUST** be allowed to return to it to eat or take a chunk before being Aggressive Called <:potaggressivecall:1047043843771604994>ï»¿away.

    - An eligible herbivore is the same/higher tier than you, or similar/larger in height and weight as you. 
    - Look out! A meat-shield could choose to leave you behind, or threaten you off.
    - Herbivores **CANNOT** run to herbivores outside of their species or herd to help them fight.
