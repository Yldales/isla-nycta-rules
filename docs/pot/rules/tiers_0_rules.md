## Tier 0 Rules

Keep in mind that by playing a Tier 0, you are risking death. They are the lowest on the food chain, easily killable by just being trampled and their body only lasts for 15 seconds. Reports on Tier 0 playables will be handled on case by case basis to see if you were intentionally or accidentally killed. To make up for how easily killed they are, their growth is shortened considerably and they have enough stamina/speed to dart across the map. 

- Tier 0 playables can be tolerated by all. "Can be" doesn't mean they "will be", though!

- They are not considered a body down if killed in the crossfire of a fight. 
    - When being Third Party to a hunt with a Tier 0, you can continue fighting without needing to attack it also.
    - If hunting one, that body must be eaten before hunting another one. Killing multiples without stopping to eat them one at a time is KOS and reportable. 
    - If being hunted by Tier 0 carnivores, you can defend yourself to the death. 

- They cannot claim or challenge for bodies, or participate in body challenges. Bodies they're eating from are considered unclaimed and must be eaten before hunting another player. Killing Tier 0 playables at a body is killing with an unclaimed body down. 
    - Rhamphorhynchus that are part of the pack/group are the exception and can assist in challenges.
    - As Tier 0 carnivores are tolerated, bodies can be shared with them.
    - Carnivores MUST Aggressive Call <:potaggressivecall:1047043843771604994> them away if they don't want to share the body. If they don't leave, THEN they can be attacked. 
    - Be cautious! Once threatened, they can fight back and Swarm until they're dead, retreated, or have annoyed away their target.
    - Those annoyed away can either return to try to share the body, retake it, or challenge for a different one, as a hunt cannot take place until the body is gone, or claimed by non-Tier 0 carnivores. 
    - They can steal from bodies at the risk of being bitten without warning. Let it escape if it is making an obvious attempt to leave.

- They can be tolerated by everything, though carnivores should be cautious of aggression especially when young are present.
    - If you do not want one near you, Aggressive Call <:potaggressivecall:1047043843771604994>it. If it doesn't leave, or comes back, it can be attacked.  
    - Meat-shielding rules apply https://discord.com/channels/331847112486551552/1047044226472480818/1052104758816669726; while being hunted they can hide behind others, though others cannot run to its protection. They must be wary as they can be killed without warning if they're not wanted nearby.
    - They are the ONLY playable that is allowed to pounce on others to be carried around at their own risk.
