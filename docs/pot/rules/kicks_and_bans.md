Here at Isla Nycta we go by a 5 offense system:
- 1st kick
- 2nd kick
- 3rd kick
- 4th kick / 24 hour ban
- 5th kick / Indefinite ban (can attempt to appeal after at least a month)

The staff reserves the right to skip all "warning" punishments and Permanently ban someone that has proven to have no regard for our rules or community. If you feel you were unfairly banned, create a ticket here <#931716554175963246>. The following will net you an immediate 24 hour ban:

- Mass killing (3+ bodies)
- Combat Logging/Logging out with bleed (unless utilizing <#747745677915848754> to report someone rule breaking) 

Racist/homophobic/sexist/etc comments will be an Indefinite Ban from all Isla Nycta servers and Discord if applicable. The punishment for this is often without a warning as we expect people to have common sense when it comes to these kinds of infractions. 

Every month, your offenses are reviewed to see if a mark against you will be removed. Should your ban be lifted and you receive another Indefinite Ban, it will become a Permanent instead and will not be appealed. Even if you manage to get a clean slate from the monthly removals of kicks the second punishment of an Indefinite Ban will be Permanent.

Please go to <#931716554175963246> and search for your Alderon ID to see if you've received a kick. Should you find your ID and have no recollection of the kick, please create a ticket. There you'll be able to get a complete run down of your offenses and have a chance to contest them, no matter how old the kick might be.
