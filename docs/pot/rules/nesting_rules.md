## Nesting Rules

- No sending out random invites, invites just to kill the individual, or false invites. IE: Someone asking for an allo and getting a compy egg. 
- You're allowed to adopt what your character can pack/herd with as per their profile. 
- Nests can be attacked, though be aware that you can be attacked in return without warning. **Currently nests are invulnerable, but this still applies.**
    - Those with a carnivorous diets can choose to hunt the individual if they do not have a body; Otherwise, if they run away, let them go. If they return to continue attacking the nest, they can be killed.
    - **Just a reminder of the griefing rule:** Do not grief others. Just because something "isn't a rule break" doesn't mean that it should be used in order to repeatedly harass and or grief others. This includes repeatedly breaking or camping people's nests. This is a new mechanic to the game, don't be a jerk and ruin it for people. 
- If there's a body on a nest, or in the nesting grounds, the carnivore/carnivorous omnivore must be allowed to return to the body so it can be eaten. 
    - Once they've had their fill, personal space must be honored or the carnivore/omnivore risks being threatened and attacked.
- Resource nodes cannot be challenged for and can be used by different species. Personal space rules apply.
