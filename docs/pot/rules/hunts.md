## Hunts Rules

- Distress Calls <:potdistresscall:1047043844786638880> **DO NOT** matter in a hunt, kill or be killed.
- Aggressive Calls <:potaggressivecall:1047043843771604994> do not need to be made before hunting.
- Hunts **CANNOT** take place if there is a visible, unclaimed body down, or one that has Tier 0 playables around it; it **must** first be eaten or claimed by another party.
    - **ONLY** player bodies count as a body down. 
    - Once there is a body down, fighting must stop from all parties, and challenges can be made for the body down if necessary.
    - As Tier 0 are tolerated, bodies can be shared with them.
    - Carnivores MUST Aggressive Call <:potaggressivecall:1047043843771604994> them away if they don't want to share the body. If they don't leave, THEN they can be attacked. 
    - Be cautious! Once threatened, they can fight back and Swarm until they're dead, retreated, or have annoyed away their target.
    - Those annoyed away can either return to try to share the body, retake it, or challenge for a different one, as a hunt cannot take place until the body is gone, or claimed by non-Tier 0 playables.
- **NO** spawn killing/camping individuals that just logged in or attacking upon logging in. Give space and at least two minutes to fully load in before becoming aggressive, even if territory is involved. 
    - This includes those spawning in from being waystoned <:waystone:1047043840537788488> , adoption teleported, and being nested.
- Third party interference is allowed in hunts and you must be aggressive to all nearby parties involved that are not in your herd/pack.
    - The third party must target all parties involved unless they are inaccessible or Tier 0, and MUST make a challenge for the body that drops.
-  **NO** Body denying by purposely dying in a spot that makes it difficult for your hunter to access. IE:  Sinking under the water if you're a terrestrial character, cliff side ledges that are difficult to get to/get down from. 
- Land characters can escape to water when being hunted. Semi-aquatic and aquatic characters are able to use the water in anyway they choose. 
    - Concavenator, Deinocheirus, Deinosuchus, Dimetrodon, Megalania, Ocepechelon, Ophis, Sarcosuchus, Spinosaurus, Suchomimus, Kaprosuchus and Thalassodromeus are considered semi-aquatic.
    - Kaiwhekea, Eurhinosaurus, Mosasaurus and Sachicasaurus are considered fully aquatic.
- If a hunt is started on a herbivore and/or their same-species herd mates, they are able to defend themselves/their herd to the death. The predator (or one of them if it's a pack) can be killed by the herbivore to save itself.
    - An interaction is considered a hunt if a predator openly tracks a herd for an extended period of time after being warned at least twice, or if a carnivore attempts to or successfully attacks an herbivore.
    - Lingering around or walking through herds can provoke aggression. If the predator is warned at least twice and continues to linger, it can be attacked until it distances itself from the herd. Returning to antagonize the herd may lead to the predator's death.
    - If a predator makes an attack in the herbivores personal space, it can be considered a hunt, even if it wasn't the intended target.
    - If a predator makes an obvious attempt to escape, the herbivore cannot continue to chase them if the carnivore leaves line of sight of the hunt location or if the both the herbivore and predator break away from the engagement, unless the predator returns and aggresses again.
        - If you are being continuously hunted by Tier 0 predator pack, you can defend yourself to the death.
