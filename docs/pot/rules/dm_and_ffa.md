## Deathmatch and Free-For-All Rules

- Even though the Free-For-All (FFA) servers do not have behavior/gameplay-based rules, we expect everyone to adhere to the general code of conduct for Isla Nycta's community.
- Players found to be abusing global chat for toxicity and bigotry will receive a punishment appropriate to the scale of the misdemeanor, with or without prior warning. Racism/homophobia/hate speech/etc is not tolerated in our servers whatsoever and will result in an immediate ban.
- Using unintended game exploits or hacking the game is strictly forbidden.
- Players can gain the "Marks" rank on Free For All. With this rank you can access these commands in the server:
    - Add Mark With: `/setmarks #` (/setmarks 10000)
    - Get Map Locations: `/listpoi `
    - Teleport To Locations With: `/goto [Name/POI]`
    - Give Others The Rank: `/promote [/promote AlderonID/Name Marks]`
    - Give Yourself The Rank: `!promote`
        - This only works if you have bound your ID in <#1093933185890517032>
